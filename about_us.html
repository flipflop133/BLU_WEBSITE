  <div class="Introduction">
    <h1>About us</h1>
    <h2 class="section-title">Introduction (put a catchy title here)</h2>
    <section class="section-1">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Since ages, education has been a pillar in our society but having a degree is now a requirement to get a job in most businesses. Unfortunately, all students haven’t the same ease to get the required grades at school because of a lack of
        comprehension in the courses.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Actually, according to reports, only few students succeed to find a teacher and fewer have enough money to pay expensive teachers.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        This is where Blu joins the game. Blu is a free and easy-to-use meeting app with one goal: to allow both students and teachers to achieve their objectives. Students can find available teachers to give them courses in a swipe and teachers can
        share their precious knowledge and earn money at the same time.
      </p>
    </section>

  </div>

  <!-- section 2-->
  <div class="Reasons">
    <h2 class="section-title">How we started</h2>
    <section class="section-2">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Everything started because we were students and like most students, we often needed help to understand our courses, but the catch was that it was always hard and tricky to find teachers who would accept to give us lessons.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Moreover, we were convinced that everybody has the potential to succeed in their studies and that in most cases, students just need a little boost.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Thus, in a world where everyone is connected with everyone, we saw the opportunity that was offered to us. That’s why we created an app, so here comes our idea of an app allowing both students and teachers to meet together on an independent
        platform.
      </p>
    </section>

  </div>

  <!-- section 3-->
  <div class="Objectives">
    <h2 class="section-title">Objectives and constraints</h2>
    <section class="section-3">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Our main goal is to offer something both affordable and easy to use for students, who already encounter some difficulty in paying off their studies.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        In order to enable students to pay the fairest price, the app simply rests on the concurrence principle. Indeed, teachers on the app whose prices are too expensive will not get any students.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        To fight the price issue, students will also be able to rate teachers, so any high price will have to be justified to receive the corresponding rate score.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Furthermore, we believe that this competition between users who will give lessons will make them motivated and will boost students’ grades.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Additionally, to fulfil our wish of making this help accessible for a majority of students, they will be able to select the closest teacher to them. As a matter of fact, students rarely own a car so this will be a great help.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Students will also be able to give lessons in courses that they master the most. Thus, they will earn money and therefore be able to pay for other students or teachers to help them in courses that they master the least.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        It could also be a great opportunity for newly graduated teachers who still don’t have a job and want some experience, also earning money at the same time.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Then, we faced a huge problem: to ensure the quality of the lessons given by the teachers. In order to deal with this issue, we opted for a control of the teachers’ certificates and decided to allow uncertified teachers such as students to
        get a free online certificate on the topic of their choice. This measure only comes in addition to the ranking system of the teachers that will be the result of students’ ratings. Apart from this, we will also reward the best teachers to
        motivate them to be on top of this ranking.
      </p>

  <!-- section 4-->
  <div class="Solution">
    <h2 class="section-title">Design</h2>
    <section class="section-4">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        When it comes to design, most apps are too complicated with too many functions, so in order to keep things simple, intuitive and beautiful, we decided to follow the material design principle that Google developed in 2014.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Furthermore, we were inspired by other well-know and successful apps and concluded that a Tinder-like design was probably the best.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Our app will work in a similar way, you will be able to choose the preferences according to your needs, such as the maximum distance that you will be disposed to travel, the subject of your course, and the maximum price that you will be ready
        to pay.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Then you will simply have to swipe through a set of teachers that match your settings and the app will help you to take the right decision by evaluating the distance, the price and the teacher rank.

    <h2 class="section-title">Who is the team behind Blu?</h2>
    <section class="section-5">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Blu is not just an app, there’s a young and innovative team behind this project.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        At the beginning the team was only composed of two members, François Bechet and Sofian Aboutaher. They both shared the same problems to find help in their studies and they were both motivated to create their own project to solve this issue.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Then, the fate made that we met Mamadou Lamine Bah who was already helping countries to develop the core element of all society, education. As we figured out that we shared the same vision on education, he joined us with his friend, Hippolyte
        Rentmeesters.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Sofian Aboutaher is a Moroccan business man and the CEO of the BLU company. He comes from Casablanca in Morocco and now lives in Belgium. He has not always been the successful business man that he is today. When he was at university, he was
        like most students experiencing some difficulty to understand the courses and finding help was not easy. But now, he is a determined team leader. Nothing can prevent him from realizing his dream of bringing knowledge access to everyone and he
        managed to bring this whole team to the place it is today.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        François Bechet is a Belgian computer scientist; he is the engineering manager. He comes from Arlon, in Belgium. He is constantly learning to stay up to date with the latest technological stuff. He is a bit of an insomniac but after all
        someone needs to stay awake to communicate with the rest of the world.
        Like Sofian, he would like to put an end to failure at school, which causes disastrous economic and social consequences.

      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Mamadou Lamine Bah is a Guinean civil engineer, he is the implementor of the team. He comes from Conakry in Guinea and now also lives in Belgium. He travels the world to bring new brilliant ideas to the team and share the team ideology. He’s
        also always trying to implement the app in newest country, even in third world to help these parts of the world to catch up with the rest of the world. He also ensures the right implementation of the team ideas.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Hippolyte Rentmeesters is a bright and reliable economist; he is the senior team builder. As the senior of the team, he prevents us from making basic mistakes during the creation process. He also manages the economic side of the company and
        decides on the budget allocation.
      </p>

  <!-- section 6-->
  <div class="Risks">
    <h2 class="section-title">Risks</h2>
    <section class="section-6">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        When you start a huge project like this one, you know that you will face a large amount of problems and it is not only about losing money.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        The main risk of the project is not getting the audience that we expect when we will launch the app. There could be a lot of reasons why students would not be interested in the app. Nowadays most students prefer spending their money in
        parties and give their courses up quite quickly. That’s why we will focus on getting their interest and their trust.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        In order to achieve this, our team already agreed on the fact that the app will be totally free and without any ads in order to let the users focus on what is really important. We will simply take a small fee on users’ payments that will be
        executed directly through the app.
      </p>
    </section>

  </div>

  <!-- section 7-->
  <div class="Budget">
    <h2 class="section-title">You wanted to know about our financial plan, right?</h2>
    <section class="section-7">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        It is not a secret that a project like this needs funds to skyrocket, so with the experience of Mamadou Lamine Bah in this domain, we will contact both enterprises and private associations. We will allow them to be our official sponsors since
        everyone knows that every enterprise is always in search of new skilled employees.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        The app will also require servers to store all the user’s database, engineers to maintain the smooth experience of the users and some security experts to ensure the well-being of the application ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Therefore, to remunerate every team member and to assure the operation of the app without decreasing its interest to the students by applying monthly and expensive subscriptions like lots of applications do, we decided to take a small fee on
        every transaction made between the users, thus not destroying the user’s experience with tons of invasive ads as well.
      </p>
    </section>
  </div>

  <!-- section 8-->
  <div class="Conclusion">
    <h2 class="section-title">In a word…</h2>
    <section class="section-8">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Despite the risk of not getting the desired audience and the possible difficulties to control the user experience quality, we think that Blu has the ability to change the world of education by helping students to solve their incomprehension
        in some of their courses and by helping teachers and everyone who has the will to teach to share their knowledge.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        In addition to the knowledge exchange that this app will make possible, the app will also create friendship between students and teachers, which, we hope, will boost their confidence and thus their grades.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Don’t forget, you are one swipe away from success!
