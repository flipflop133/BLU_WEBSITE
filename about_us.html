      <p>Blu is not just an app, there’s a young and innovative team behind this project, with one goal, allowing both students and teachers to achieve their objectives. Students can find teachers available to give them courses near them and teachers
        can
        find students to give them quality courses.
        Blu is free, easy to use and respect your privacy.

  <div class="Reasons">
    <h2>Reasons for undertaking the project</h2>
    <section class="section-2">
      <p>All start because we were students and like most students, we often need help to understand our courses. But the catch was that it was always hard and tricky to find teachers who accept to give us courses. So here comes our idea to allow
        both
        teachers and students to meet together on an independent platform. Another problems were the price and the distance, so to solve both of them we decided to allow students to swipe teachers until they find the right one for them, close and at
        a
        fair price.</p>

    <h2>Objectives and constraints of the project</h2>
    <section class="section-3">
      <p>Our biggest problem was to ensure the quality of the courses given by the teachers. So to deal with it we decided to control the teachers certificates.</p>
