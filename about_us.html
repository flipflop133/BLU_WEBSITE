    <h1>About us</h1>
    <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
    <section class="section-1">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Since ages, education has always been a pillar in our society but having a degree is now a requirement to get a job in most business. Unfortunately, all students haven’t the same ease to get the required grades at school because of a lack of
        comprehension in the courses.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Actually, according to reports, only few students succeed to find a teacher and fewer have the money to pay expensive teachers.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        This is where Blu joins the game, Blu is a free and easy to use meeting app with one goal, allowing both students and teachers to achieve their objectives. Students can find available teachers to give them courses in a swipe and teachers can share their precious knowledge and earn money at the same time.
      </p>
    </section>

  </div>

  <!-- section 2-->
  <div class="Reasons">
    <h2 class="section-title">How we started</h2>
    <section class="section-2">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        All started because we were students and like most students, we often need help to understand our courses. But the catch was that it was always hard and tricky to find teachers who accept to give us courses.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Moreover, we were convinced that everybody has the potential to succeed in their studies and in most cases, students just need a small boost.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Hence, in a connected world where everyone is connected with everyone, we saw the opportunity that was offered to us, that’s why we jumped on the occasion to create an app, so here comes our idea of an app allowing both students and teachers
        to meet together on an independent platform.
      </p>
    </section>

  </div>

  <!-- section 3-->
  <div class="Objectives">
    <h2 class="section-title">Objectives and constraints</h2>
    <section class="section-3">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Our main goal is to offer something both affordable and easy to use for students, who already meet some difficulties to pay off their studies.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        In order to allow students to pay the fairest price, the app simply rests on the concurrence principle, indeed, teachers on the app who will ask for a too much expensive price will not get any students.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        To fight the price issue, students will also be able to rate teachers, so any high price will have to be justified to receive the corresponding rate score.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Moreover, we believe that this competition between users who will gives courses, will make them motivated and will boost student’s grades.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Additionally, to fulfil our wish of making this help accessible to the majority, students will be able to select the closest teacher near them, indeed as a matter of fact, students rarely own a car so this will be a great help.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Students will also be able to give lessons in courses that they master the most, thus they will earn money and consequently they will be able to pay for other students or teachers who will help them in courses that they master the least.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        It could also be a good opportunity for newly graduated teachers that still don’t have a job and want some experience and also earn money at the same time.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Then, we were facing a huge problem, ensuring the quality of the courses given by the teachers. So, in order to deal with this issue, we decided to opt for the control of the teacher’s certificates and allow uncertified teachers such as
        students to get a free online certificate on the topic of their choice. This measure only comes in addition to the ranking system of the teachers that will be the result of student’s ratings. Apart from this, we will also reward best
        teachers, to motivate them to be on top of this ranking.
      </p>

  <!-- section 4-->
  <div class="Solution">
    <h2 class="section-title">Design</h2>
    <section class="section-4">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        When it comes to the design, most of the apps are too complicated with too much functions so in order to keep things simple, intuitive and beautiful, we decided to follow the material design principle that Google developed in 2014.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Furthermore, we were inspired by other well-know and successful apps therefore we concluded that a tinder like design was probably the best.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Our app will work in a similar way, you will be able to choose the preferences of your needs, like the maximum distance that you will be disposed to travel, the subject of your course, and the maximum price that you will be ready to pay.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Then you will just have to swipe through a set of teachers that match your settings and the app will help to take the right decision by evaluating the distance, the price and the teacher rank.

    <h2 class="section-title">Who is the team behind Blu?</h2>
    <section class="section-5">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Blu is not just an app, there’s a young and innovative team behind this project.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        At the beginning the team was only composed of two members, François Bechet and Sofian Aboutaher. They were both sharing the same troubles to find help in their studies and they were both motivated to create their own project to solve this
        issue.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Then, the fate made that we met Mamadou Lamine Bah who was already helping countries to develop the core element of all society, the education. As we figured out that we were sharing the same vision of how the education should be he joined us
        with his friend, Hippolyte Rentmeesters.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Sofian Aboutaher is a Moroccan business man, he is the CEO of the BLU company. He comes from Casablanca in Morocco and now lives in Belgium. He has not always been the successful business man that he is today, when he was at university, he
        was like most students experiencing some troubles to understand the courses and finding help wasn’t easy. But now he’s a determined team leader, nothing can stop him to realize his dream of bringing knowledge access to everyone and he managed
        to bring this whole team to where it is today.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        François Bechet is a Belgian computer scientist; he is the engineering manager. He comes from Arlon in Belgium. He is constantly learning to stay up to date with the latest technology stuff. He’s a bit sleep derivative but after all someone
        needs to stay awake to communicate with the rest of the world.
        Like Sofian, he would like to end up with scholarship failure that causes disastrous economic and social consequences.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Mamadou Lamine Bah is a Guinean civil engineer, he is the implementor of the team. He comes from Conakry in Guinea and now also lives in Belgium. He travels the world to bring new brilliant ideas to the team and share the team ideology. He’s
        also always trying to implement the app in newest country, even in third world to help these parts of the world to catch up with the rest of the world. He also ensures the right implementation of the team ideas.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Hippolyte Rentmeesters is a bright and reliable economist; he is the senior team builder. As the senior of the team, he avoids us the basic mistakes trough the creation process. He also manages the economic side of the company and decide the
        budget allocation.
      </p>

  <!-- section 6-->
  <div class="Risks">
    <h2 class="section-title">Risks</h2>
    <section class="section-6">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        When you start a huge project like this one, you know that you will face a large amount of problems and it’s not only about losing money.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        The main risk of the project is not getting the awaited audience that we expect when we will launch the app. There could be a lot of reasons why students wouldn’t be interested in the app, nowadays most students prefer spending their money in
        parties and give up quickly on their courses that’s why we will focus on getting their interest and their trust.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        In order to achieve this, our team already agreed on the fact that the app will be totally free to use and without any ads to let the users focus on what is really important. We will simply take a small fee on users’ payments that will be
        executed directly through the app.
      </p>
    </section>

  </div>

  <!-- section 7-->
  <div class="Budget">
    <h2 class="section-title">You wanted to know about our financial plan, right?</h2>
    <section class="section-7">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        It’s not a secret anymore, that a project like this needs funds to skyrocket, so with the experience of Mamadou Lamine Bah in this domain, we will contact both enterprises and private associations, we will allow them to be our official
        sponsors, and everyone knows that every enterprises are always in search of new skilled employees.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        The app will also require servers to store all the user’s database, engineers to maintain the smooth experience of the user and some security experts to ensure the well-being of the application ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Therefore, to remunerate all the team members and thus to assure the operation of the app without decreasing the app interest to the students by applying monthly and expensive subscriptions like lots of applications and without destroying the
        user experience with tons of invasive ads, we decided to take a small fee on every transaction made between the users.
      </p>
    </section>
  </div>

  <!-- section 8-->
  <div class="Conclusion">
    <h2 class="section-title">In a word…</h2>
    <section class="section-8">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Despite, the risk of not getting the desired audience and the possible difficulties to control the user experience quality, we still think that Blu has the ability to change the world of education by helping students to solve their courses
        incomprehension’s and by helping teachers and everyone who has the will to do it to share their knowledges.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        In addition to the knowledge exchange that this app will make possible, the app will also create friendship between students and teachers, that we hope will boost their confidence and thus their grades.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Don’t forget, you are at one swipe of the success!
